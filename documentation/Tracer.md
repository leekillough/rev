# Overview

The Rev tracer currently provides compact visualization of instruction execution with disassembly and effects on registers and memory. The architecture is intended to be extensible to support more complex pipelines and controls to enhance productivity while reducing simulator output and associated post-processing.

# Usage

## Compile options

The execution tracer is configured using the following cmake compile options:

- REV_TRACER=ON     : compile for tracing (default)
- REV_TRACER=OFF    : do not compile in tracing support
- REV_USE_SPIKE=ON  : Use spike libdiasm.a for disassembly
- REV_USE_SPIKE=OFF : Use internal REV instruction format (default)
        
When setting REV_USE_SPIKE to ON, GCC tools and links to libdisasm.a must be available. These are part of rev_isa_sim (Spike). If this library is not found the tracer should revert to the an internal REV format.

Previous instruction execution trace output is replaced by the compact tracer format. Compiling with REV_TRACER=0 will revert the output to to the old format and elliminate any possible performance impacts.

## Runtime options

The tracer is enabled using verbosity >= 5.

sst-info revcpu will now includes the following additional options:

  - trcOp: Tracer instruction trigger  [slli]
  - trcLimit: Max trace lines per core (0 no limit)  [0]
  - trcStartCycle: Starting tracer cycle (disables trcOp)  [0]

To achieve compact traces, the tracer is initially off. The user must enable it using one of two methods:

  a. Programatic Controls: These are 'nop' instructions embedded in the target code that will activate or deactive tracing. This allows for tracing only specific code of interest and avoiding extreme file sizes. The 'trcOp' option provides the base opcode and must be the following subset of custom hints defined in the RISCV specification:
     
                 slti, sltiu, slli, srli, srai

  b. Cycle Based control: This simply allows the user to specify a starting cycle to start tracing for a CPU. This will affect all cores and will defeat all programatic controls. However, setting 'trcCycle' to 0 will have no effect.
     
    Important: trcStartCycle and trcLimit are specified in terms of REV cycles, not time.

## Test Sample

## Build and Run

After building the Rev core  using the instructions provided in Readme.md,
simply

    cd test/tracer; make clean; make

Excerpts of source code and associated output are provided in the sample
traces at the end of this document.

## Tracing Macros

Programatic controls are realized through macros provided in 'rev-macros.h'. The default values are:

    #define TRACE_OFF      asm volatile("slli x0,x0,0"); 
    #define TRACE_ON       asm volatile("slli x0,x0,1"); 
    #define TRACE_PUSH_OFF asm volatile("slli x0,x0,2"); 
    #define TRACE_PUSH_ON  asm volatile("slli x0,x0,3"); 
    #define TRACE_POP      asm volatile("slli x0,x0,4");

If there is a conflict with the 'slli' instruction, it can instruction can be changed using the 'trcOp' option. The header file must be changedto match or tracing will not be enabled. See 2.2 for the list of supported instructions.

When one of these instruction is encountered the trace will indicate and on or off event using '+' or '-' before the instruction mnemonic.

Example: 

The prefix fields showing cycle, cpu, thread, and hart information are omitted.

    // Tracing starts
    0x10330:00301013  + slli    zero, zero, 3   0x0<-zero zero<-0x0 pc<-0x10334
    0x10334:fec42703    lw      a4, -20(s0)     0x3ffffba0<-s0 0x000003de<-[0x3ffffb8c,4] a4<-0x3de 
    0x10338:3de00793    li      a5, 990         0x0<-zero a5<-0x3de 
    0x1033c:00f70463    beq     a4, a5, pc + 8  0x3de<-a4 0x3de<-a5 pc<-0x10344
    0x10344:00201013  - slli    zero, zero, 2   0x0<-zero zero<-0x0
    // Tracing ends and then resumes at a later cycle
    0x10358:00301013  + slli    zero, zero, 3   0x0<-zero zero<-0x0 pc<-0x1035c 
    0x1035c:fec42783    lw      a5, -20(s0)     0x3ffffba0<-s0 0x00000000<-[0x3ffffb8c,4] a5<-0x0 
    0x10360:00078463    beqz    a5, pc + 8      0x0<-a5 0x0<-zero pc<-0x10368 
    0x10368:00201013  - slli    zero, zero, 2   0x0<-zero zero<-0x0 
    // tracing ends

# Tracer Output

## Logging prefix

  The tracer output is prefixed by the standard logging information with
  an additional text to support extraction from the log file.

    |--   Standard logging prefix                              --| key |
      RevCPU[cpu0:InstTrace:18156000]: Core 0; Hart 0; Thread 1]; *I 

## Instruction Disassembly

### REV_USE_SPIKE=ON

    |  PC  : INSN      |  Disassembly     |
    0x10474:00c50533    add     a0, a0, a2

### REV_USE_SPIKE=OFF

    |  PC  : INSN      |  Disassembly      |
    0x10474:00c50533    add %rd, %rs1, %rs2

## Register to Register Format

    |  PC   : INSN     |  Disassembly             |         Effects          |
    0x10474:00c50533    add     a0, a0, a2        0x14<-a0 0x50<-a2 a0<-0x64 

  Notice that the effects include the same register naming conventions as the disassembled instruction. 

  Effects interpretation:
  - data<-reg  : Source register read
  - reg<-data  : Destination register write

## Register to Memory (Store)

    |  PC  : INSN    |     Disassembly    |
    0x10220:fef42623  sw      a5, -20(s0)

    |                    Effects                        |
      0x3ffffb60<-s0 0x64<-a5 [0x3ffffb4c,4]<-0x00000064

  Effects interpretation:
   - data<-reg  : Source register read
   - [logical address, number of bytes]<-data : write initiated from core

## Memory to Register (Load) - Simple Memory

  When "enable_memh" is 0, memory load effects are shown in the same cycle as instruction execution.

    |  PC  : INSN    |    Disassembly      |
    0x102d4:fec42783    lw      a5, -20(s0)

    |                          Effects                              |
    0x3fefff90<-s0 0x0<-a5 0xacee1190<-[0x3fefff7c,4] a5<-0xacee1190  
  
  Effects interpretation:

   - data<-reg  : Source register read
   - reg<-data  : Destination register write
   - reg<-[logical address, number of bytes] : returning load data

## Memory to Register (Load) - Memory Hierarchy

  When "enable_memh" is 1 and the RevMemCtrl subcomponent is used, the issuing of the load and the load effects are separated. This is shown in the following trace. The prefix showing Core, Hart, and Thread information has been omitted.
       
    (1) *I 0x1511c:0007ae83 lw   t4, 0(a5)     0x3ffffbc8<-a5 t4<-[0x3ffffbc8,4]
    (2) *I 0x15120:fffe0e13 addi t3, t3, -1    0x1<-t3 t3<-0x0
    (3) *A 0x1ace4ff0<-[0x3ffffbc8,4] t4<-0x1ace4ff0
    (4) *I 0x15124:001e8e93 addi t4, t4, 1     0x1ace4ff0<-t4 t4<-0x1ace4ff1

  Instruction execution is preceded by '*I' and asynchronous events, such as the returning load data, is preceded by '*A'. 

  Effects interpretation:
  - Cycle 1: t4<-[0x3ffffbc8,4] :  
  The load request is send to the memory component. In this case, 4 bytes are read from 0x3ffffbc8 and the results will eventually be written into register t4. The t4 register is marked as 'busy' so that any instruction that depends on register t4 will stall until the load completes.
  - Cycle 2: addi t3, t3, -1    0x1<-t3 t3<-0x0  
  This is an independent instruction that does not depend on t4. It is free to execute without stalling.
  - Cycle 3: *A 0x1ace4ff0<-[0x3ffffbc8,4] t4<-0x1ace4ff0  
    This is the asynchronous load completion showing the memory location and number of bytes read, the returning load data, and the write to register t4.
  - Cycle 4: addi t4, t4, 1     0x1ace4ff0<-t4    
  An instruction that depends on register t4 that must be stalled until the t4 register scoreboard bit is cleared by the preceding load completion.

## Program Counter Writes (Branches/Jumps)

    |  PC   | INSN   |  Disassembly  |             Effects                       |
    0x102a8:f35ff0ef  jal  pc - 0xcc  0x0<-ra ra<-0x102ac pc<-0x101dc <_Z5checki>

  Effects interpretation:
   - data<-reg  : Source register read
   - reg<-data  : Destination link register write
   - pc<-address: Resolved branch target
   - <_Z5checki> : Matching ELF symbol associated with new PC
   
# Sample Traces

The source code for these samples is found in <rev>/test/tracer.
All the trace prefixes have been removed or modified for readability.

Review tracer.c and the generated disassembly and log files for additional
illustrative trace test cases.

## Traced assertion macro

  This example demonstrates the usage of the following macros defined
  in rev-macros.h 
  
    #define TRACE_PUSH_ON  asm volatile("slli x0,x0,3"); 
    #define TRACE_POP      asm volatile("slli x0,x0,4");
    #define TRACE_ASSERT(x) { TRACE_PUSH_ON; \
    if (!(x)) { asm volatile(".word 0x0"); }; \
    TRACE_PUSH_OFF }

  For this line of C code:  
  
    TRACE_ASSERT(res*2==1980);

  We have the following disassembly.

    147e4:  00301013   sll      zero,zero,0x3  // TRACE_PUSH_ON
    147e8:  fec42703   lw      a4,-20(s0)
    147ec:  3de00793   li      a5,990
    147f0:  00f70463   beq     a4,a5,147f8 <main+0xa4>
    147f4:  0000       .2byte  0x0
    147f6:  0000       .2byte  0x0
    147f8:  00201013   sll     zero,zero,0x2  // TRACE_POP

  And the following trace:

    1  0x147e4:00301013  + slli  zero, zero, 3   0x0<-zero zero<-0x0 pc<-0x147e8 
    2  0x147e8:fec42703    lw      a4, -20(s0)   0x3ffffba0<-s0 0x000003de<-[0x3ffffb8c,4] a4<-0x3de 
    3  0x147ec:3de00793    li      a5, 990       0x0<-zero a5<-0x3de 
    4  0x147f0:00f70463    beq     a4, a5, pc+8  0x3de<-a4 0x3de<-a5 pc<-0x147f8 
    5  0x147f8:00201013  - slli    zero, zero, 2  0x0<-zero zero<-0x0 

 Line by line interpretation:
 
 Cycle 1:  
 - The '+' indicates the first line of a trace sequence. This TRACE_PUSH_ON macro will push the current state of the tracer onto a stack and enable tracing.
- 0x0<-zero : indicates the x0 register has been read
- pc<-0x147e8: The tracer prints the program counter at the start of new traces or for any branch occurance.

Cycle 2:   
- 0x3ffffba0<-s0 : s0 read for part of the memory address calculation.
- 0x000003de<-[0x3ffffb8c,4]:
- 4 bytes are read from memory location 0x3ffffb8c. The data is 0x3de.
- a4<-0x3de : Register a4 is written with the return load data.

Cycle 3:  
- 0x0<-zero:  'li' is  implementation an 'addi' using the x0 register.
- a5<-0x3de:  a5 is written with the immediate field

Cycle 4: 
- 0x3de<-a4 0x3de<-a5: Read of the 2 sources being compared.
- pc<-0x147f8: target instruction address for the taken branch.
 
Cycle 5:
- The '-' indicates that tracing is being disabled.

## 32-bit vs 64-bit instructions

   Here is a sequence of memory accesses using byte, half-word, and word data. The data is -1 in order to observe the effects of sign extensions.
   
   This sequence is run on using REV configured for RV32I instructions.

    li      t3, -1      0x0<-zero t3<-0xffffffff
    sb      t3, 0(a5)   0x3ffffb78<-a5 0xff<-t3 [0x3ffffb78,1]<-0xff 
    lb      t4, 0(a5)   0x3ffffb78<-a5 0xff<-[0x3ffffb78,1] t4<-0xffffffff 
    sh      t3, 0(a5)   0x3ffffb78<-a5 0xffff<-t3 [0x3ffffb78,2]<-0xffff 
    lh      t4, 0(a5)   0x3ffffb78<-a5 0xffff<-[0x3ffffb78,2] t4<-0xffffffff
    sw      t3, 0(a5)   0x3ffffb78<-a5 0xffffffff<-t3 [0x3ffffb78,4]<-0xffffffff 
    lw      t4, 0(a5)   0x3ffffb78<-a5 0xffffffff<-[0x3ffffb78,4] t4<-0xffffffff

   This next sequence also includes 64-bit operations and is run using RV64G instructions.
   
    li      t3, -1    0x0<-zero t3<-0xffffffffffffffff 
    sb      t3, 0(a5) 0x3ffffb28<-a5 0xff<-t3 [0x3ffffb28,1]<-0xff 
    lb      t4, 0(a5) 0x3ffffb28<-a5 0xff<-[0x3ffffb28,1] t4<-0xffffffffffffffff 
    sh      t3, 0(a5) 0x3ffffb28<-a5 0xffff<-t3 [0x3ffffb28,2]<-0xffff 
    lh      t4, 0(a5) 0x3ffffb28<-a5 0xffff<-[0x3ffffb28,2] t4<-0xffffffffffffffff 
    sw      t3, 0(a5) 0x3ffffb28<-a5 0xffffffff<-t3 [0x3ffffb28,4]<-0xffffffff 
    lw      t4, 0(a5) 0x3ffffb28<-a5 0xffffffff<-[0x3ffffb28,4] t4<-0xffffffffffffffff 
    addi    a5, s0, -48   0x3ffffb58<-s0 a5<-0x3ffffb28 
    sd      t3, 0(a5) 0x3ffffb28<-a5 0xffffffffffffffff<-t3 [0x3ffffb28,8]<-0xffffffffffffffff 
    lwu     t4, 0(a5) 0x3ffffb28<-a5 0xffffffff<-[0x3ffffb28,4] t4<-0xffffffff 
    ld      t4, 0(a5) 0x3ffffb28<-a5 0xffffffffffffffff<-[0x3ffffb28,8] t4<-0xffffffffffffffff 

   Observe that the data for each memory read matches the data size.
   
    sb:      [0x3ffffb28,1]<-0xff  
    lb:                0xff<-[0x3ffffb28,1]
    sh:      [0x3ffffb28,2]<-0xffff 
    lh:              0xffff<-[0x3ffffb28,2]
    sw:      [0x3ffffb28,4]<-0xffffffff   
    lw:          0xffffffff<-[0x3ffffb28,4]
    sd:      [0x3ffffb28,8]<-0xffffffffffffffff
    lwu:         0xffffffff<-[0x3ffffb28,4] 
    ld:  0xffffffffffffffff<-[0x3ffffb28,8]

   The final register writes for loads are sign-extended except when using lwu. The register write size depends on whether using 32-bit or 64-bit designs.

    lb (32-bit): t4<-0xffffffff 
    lb (64-bit): t4<-0xffffffffffffffff 
    lwu(64-bit): t4<-0xffffffff 
    ld (64-bit): t4<-0xffffffffffffffff 


# Issues/Enhancements

  - Instruction tracing for integer operations is mostly covered. Other
    instruction types (floating point, coprocessor, vector,... ) are not.

  - Effects of atomic memory operations are not yet traced.
  
  - ECalls are also not yet traced

  - Tracing information may be sent to different output streams in more
    compact formats in the future.

  - When using the internal Rev instruction formatter only the opcode
    is printed. It should be possible to support a full disassembler
    within REV.In general, threading with tracing has not been tested.

  - Loads that target the zero register (x0) are not shown.
